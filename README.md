Task Description:

Create a food ordering website focusing on showcasing Tel Aviv's most renowned restaurants. Users should be able to browse through these restaurants, view their menu, and select dishes for their orders.

Key Features:

Restaurant Display: The website should prominently feature Tel Aviv's top restaurants. Clicking on a restaurant should lead to a page displaying its dishes.
Menu Display: Each restaurant's page should showcase its dishes. Users can click on a dish to view more details.
Filtering Options: Users should be able to filter restaurants based on popularity level, opening date, and opening hours.
Ordering Functionality: Users should be able to add dishes to their current order. Clicking on a dish should open a modal window for easy ordering.
Search Functionality: A search field on the main page should enable users to search for restaurants, chefs, and dishes.
Data Management: All site information (restaurants, dishes, chefs, order history) should be stored in static JSON files. Future iterations may involve extracting data from a local database once server-side functionality is implemented.
